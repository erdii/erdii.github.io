Just rename the file in finder, stage all un-staged changes in SourceTree, commit and push.
But&amp;hellip; the only thing that happened was that SourceTree complained about not being able to find files in the old foldername. So I googled a bit and found a solution.
How to really do it Just use git mv on the shell!</description></item></channel></rss>
